3. **Binary Grading**: Provide a binary score ('yes' or 'no') to indicate whether the user's question is relevant to determining a policy recommendation. To be graded as 'yes,' the question must address **age**, **sum assured**, and **financial goal** in a meaningful way.

   - **Age**: Does the question mention or imply the userâ€™s age, which helps in recommending a policy suited to their stage in life?
   - **Sum Assured**: Has the user specified a desired sum assured or coverage amount that reflects the level of financial protection or savings they need?
   - **Financial Goal**: Does the question clarify the user's financial objective, such as life insurance for family protection, or a retirement plan for long-term savings?

2. **Identifying Missing Information**: If any of the three key elements (age, sum assured, financial goal) are missing or unclear, notify the user and provide guidance on what to include.
